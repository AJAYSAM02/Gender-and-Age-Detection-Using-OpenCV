# Gender-and-Age-Detection-Using-OpenCV
A gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person by analyzing the face of the person in a picture using Deep Learning.

## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision.  
It is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library.  
This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities.  

## What is a CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep neural network widely used for the purposes of image recognition and processing and NLP. 

## ABOUT PROJECT
In this project, we will use Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. We will use a pre-trained model by  Tal Hassner and Gil Levi.
The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100).
It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions.
Hence, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

## STEPS
Detect faces  
Classify into Male/Female  
Classify into one of the 8 age ranges  
Put the results on the image and display it
